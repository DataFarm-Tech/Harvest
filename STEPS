1. Listen for lora msg
2. If it passes CRC check then continue
3. Extract src, dest, data
4. if dest == sensors_nodeId then process it, else relay to next node (send_packet())
5. when process packet, send a packet back to the src node with data attached.


- Create a thread that constantly listens for lora messages
- read data from lora into buffer
- then pass buffer into crc check (if crc check passes then continue)
- retrieving src, dest, data

then retrieve src, dest and data
- function 1: retrieve data, returns data from sensor
- function 2: combine lora listener (src, and dest is within) with funciton 1 (data).
